Thalia (youth and beauty) is accompanied by Euphrosyne (mirth), and Aglaia (elegance).It was commissioned from Antonio Canova by John Russel, 6th Duke of Bedford, who visited the sculptor in his studio in Rome in 1814, and was captivated by the group of the Three Graces which Canova had carved for the Empress Josephine, the estranged wife of Napoleon Bonaparte. She had died in May of that year, and the Duke offered to buy the group from Canova, but Josephine’s son claimed it, and that version is now in the Hermitage, St Petersburg.",
