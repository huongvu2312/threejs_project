# ThreeJS - Museum Exhibition

This is a small project to create animations based on threejs library.

The main theme of the project is a museum exhibition, in which each art model will be shown together with their information, and user can move the model around to have the 360-degree observation of the model.

All models are taken from [Geoffrey Marchal](https://sketchfab.com/geoffreymarchal) under CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike.

The format of the model is glTF (GL Transmission Format), the [recommended format of the official three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models).
